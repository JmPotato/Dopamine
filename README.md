# Dopamine

Dopamine is a simple and fast Python web framework which aims to help you build an app agilely. It's based on gevent's `pywsgi`, a pure-Python, gevent-friendly WSGI server. Benefiting from a high-level synchronous API on top of the `libev` or `libuv` event loop, dopamine could be fast to respond every HTTP request without the user to do any extra work. Also, dopamine will stay in both easy-using and powerfuly to help you build some simple apps agilely.

    html += 'Your host is {0}:{1}<br>'.format(
        request.remote_addr, request.remote_port)
